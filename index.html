           In Malaysia, the healthcare system is a mix of public and private sectors. The public healthcare 
           system is primarily managed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and provides services through government 
           hospitals and clinics.The private healthcare sector, on the other hand, caters to those who can afford 
           it and offers a wider range of services, often with shorter waiting times and more amenities.Overall, 
           Malaysia has made significant strides in improving healthcare access and infrastructure over the years, 
           though challenges such as healthcare financing, regional disparities, and the burden of non-communicable diseases persist.
